# Minal-Fantasy

## Description

This is our final group project for the UofT fullstack bootcamp and we decided to make a new twitst on some old classic games. Minesweeper except when you click the mine, its actually a monster and play an entire rpg around this concept. It really tested everything we learned up to this point and forced us to keep learning new ways to deal with issues we would have never even imagined.

## Usage

When you visit our site, you can login in the top right hand corner. If you do not have an account you can make a new one in this area. After you are logged in, you will be able to play the game by clicking the play button and then the start button on the game page.
